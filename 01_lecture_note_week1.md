### Write a beautiful program
To write a beautiful program, breakdown solution to small pieces. This is called modular programming. Think of lego blocks which allow you to create whatever you imagine by interchanging lego blocks. Same is true with programming. Scratch also allows modular programming using functions.

### Practice:

#### 1. Even or Odd
Write a scratch program to accept a number and check if the number is even or odd.

#### Instructions:
- A number is even if a number is divisible by 2. In other words, a number is a even number if the remainder is zero after the number is divided by 2. Scratch provides "mod" operator for the remainder calculation.

<br /><br />

#### Example 1:

#### 2. Scratch program to check leap year
Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.

Write a scratch program to check if a given year is a leap year.

#### Instructions:
1. Using a pencil and paper, write down several examples such as 400, 1700, 1800, 1900, 1600, 2000 and 2004.
2. Write down the logic with a pencil and paper before starting to write code.
3. Test if the logic is correct.
4. Once logic is complete, start to write down beautiful code that means code should be modular, simple and optimized.

<br /><br />

#### Example:

##### Pseudocode (Using pencil and paper):
```
If num % 400 == 0
  Leap
Else If num % 100 == 0
  NoLeap
Else If num % 4 == 0
  Leap
Else
  No Leap
```
